            IA should've just Googled for his hideout, evidently. I was set up. By the Brits. A group of British builders operating outside the O.C. A flower in my garden, a mystery in my panties.

This was a big get for God. A Colombian cartel that WON'T kidnap and kill you. Yes, she happens to be more experienced than a normal girl, but sometimes love should be… terrifying.
